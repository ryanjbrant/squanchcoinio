# Squanch Coin

An interdimensional cryptocurrency portal powered by quantum computing and Rick and Morty-style innovation.

## Features

- Interactive quantum portal with dynamic TV static effect
- Terminal-style interface with realistic hacking simulation
- AI-powered artifact generation using OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALL-E 3
- Responsive design for all devices
- Immersive user experience with dynamic loading sequences

## Terminal Functionality

The quantum terminal is a sophisticated interface that simulates interdimensional artifact generation:

- **Initialization**: Press 'Y' to start the quantum sequence
- **Loading Phases**: Multiple stages of quantum stabilization and dimensional scanning
- **Safety Protocols**: Two-step verification process requiring user confirmation
- **Password Challenge**: Memory dump analysis requiring hex code identification
- **Artifact Generation**: Automated process combining quantum data with AI visualization

### Important Notes

- Do not interrupt the terminal during quantum stabilization phases
- Allow all loading sequences to complete naturally
- Password attempts are limited to prevent dimensional instability
- Memory dumps contain critical hex codes - analyze carefully

## Artifact Generation

Artifacts are generated through a combination of quantum computing and AI:

1. **Quantum Seed**: Initial data generation through dimensional scanning
2. **AI Processing**: OpenAI DALL-E 3 visualization of quantum data
3. **Safety Protocols**: Automated checks for dimensional stability
4. **Fallback System**: Static backup in case of quantum destabilization

### Critical Information

- Each artifact is unique across all dimensions
- Generated images are automatically stabilized
- Survival tips are crucial for artifact handling
- Quantum signatures are non-repeatable

## API Configuration

The project uses OpenAI's API for artifact visualization. The current project key format is correct and working:

```bash
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-*****
```

### Important API Notes

- Do NOT change the API key format - project keys are required
- Keep quantum stabilization active during API calls
- Maintain proper environment variable configuration
- Restart the development server after any API changes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key (project key format)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanjbrant/squanchcoinio.git
cd squanchcoinio
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
```
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_project_key_here
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technology Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- OpenAI API (GPT-4 & DALL-E 3)
- WebGL Shaders

## Troubleshooting

- If artifacts fail to generate, check quantum stabilization status
- For API errors, verify project key format
- If terminal freezes, allow safety protocols to complete
- Memory dumps should always contain valid hex codes
